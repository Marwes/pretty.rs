# rust-pretty

A pretty printer library for rust.

## Synopsis

This library is based on Larsen's SML translation (https://github.com/kfl/wpp) of Wadler's Haskell pretty printer (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf).

## Requirements

1.   [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/)
2.   [Cargo](http://crates.io/)

You can install both with the following:

```
$ curl -s https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo sh
```

See [Installing Rust](http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html#installing-rust) for further details.

## Usage

```
$ cargo build       ## build library and binary
$ cargo run         ## run binary (does nothing useful yet)
```
